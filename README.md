# Challenge Part I

## About 
This repository contains the second part of the challenge, browser automation of http://automationpractice.com/. Only supported for Chrome Driver.

## Built With
- Java SE Development Kit 14
- TestNG 6.14.3
- Selenium Webdriver Java 3.141.59
- Selenium Chrome Driver 3.141.59

## How to run 
Clone the source code or download the zip, and preferably run the tests inside any Java IDE with the IDE runner, however I would recommend Intellij since I've used it.
You can find the main runner  <strong> src --> test --> java --> TestRunner.java </strong> file, or you can also run the the test case file <strong> TestClass.java </strong>. All of the libraries
I've used are included in the <strong> lib </strong> folder, and I've added them manually since I had troubles with including all the dependencies in Maven. 

## Test Reports
After each run you should be able to find test reports inside <strong> test-output --> index.html </strong> file. Currently the latest successful report that I had is uploaded.
